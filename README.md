# Google Profile Catcher
A simple Node.js application created to get information relevant to backend integrations using Google's social login system.
## Recommendations
Is recommended to read the official [Google Social Login integration](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in) before or while using this repository. But chill, it's just a friend's tip :smile:, you can completely ignore it.
## How to use
1. Replace the "content" attribute to your Google's project Client ID.  
2. Run the application's server, and access it.
3. Click on the "Login" button.
4. Catch your info. :sunglasses:.
